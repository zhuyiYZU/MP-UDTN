Due to the lack of structured descriptions for the numerical information in the thyroid ultrasound image dataset, we collaborated with medical experts to design a unified description template. This template was used to interpret and standardize the numerical data, leveraging professional knowledge. By mapping the size, location, and margin features of thyroid nodules to predefined templates, the model is able to more effectively learn and classify images based on this structured information. Ultimately, these structured outputs were incorporated into the modelâ€™s multimodal input, combining text information with image features to enhance the diagnostic accuracy and the model's ability to differentiate between various pathological features.
